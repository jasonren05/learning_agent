Effective time management is crucial for success in both academic and professional settings. By prioritizing tasks and setting clear goals, individuals can enhance productivity and reduce stress. Allocating specific time slots for different activities ensures a balanced approach to work and leisure.

### 3. Key Grammatical Structures Analysis  


#### **1. Prepositional Phrase as a Manner Adverbial: "By prioritizing tasks..."**  
- **Structure**: *By + gerund (verb-ing) + object*  
- **Function**: Indicates the method or means by which an action is performed. Often used at the beginning of a sentence to introduce a strategy or approach (common in academic writing to explain "how" something is achieved).  
- **Example in the Article**:  
  *"By prioritizing tasks and setting clear goals, individuals can enhance productivity and reduce stress."*  
- **Usage Note**: This structure is widely used in IELTS/TOEFL Writing Task 2 (e.g., "By investing in renewable energy, countries can mitigate climate change").  


#### **2. Non-Restrictive Relative Clause: "which are essential for achieving long-term objectives"**  
- **Structure**: *主句, which + 谓语 + 其他* (non-restrictive: provides extra, non-essential information; commas separate it from the main clause).  
- **Function**: Adds supplementary details about a noun (here, "discipline and self-control"). Unlike restrictive clauses, it cannot be removed without making the sentence grammatically incomplete.  
- **Example in the Article**:  
  *"Moreover, it fosters discipline and self-control, which are essential for achieving long-term objectives."*  
- **Comparison with Restrictive Clauses**:  
  - Restrictive (no commas): "The skills which are taught in this course are critical." (limits "skills" to those taught in the course)  
  - Non-restrictive (with commas): "The course, which is taught by experts, is popular." (adds extra info about "the course")  


#### **3. "It" as a Formal Subject: "it is imperative for maintaining..."**  
- **Structure**: *It + be verb + adjective + for sth./sb. + to-infinitive* (where "it" replaces the real subject, a to-infinitive phrase, to avoid awkwardness).  
- **Function**: Used in formal writing to emphasize the importance/necessity of an action. The real subject ("to maintain a competitive edge...") is placed at the end for clarity.  
- **Example in the Article**:  
  *"it is imperative for maintaining a competitive edge and leading a fulfilling life."* (Real subject: "to maintain... life")  
- **Common Adjectives in This Structure**: crucial, essential, necessary, vital, important (e.g., "It is crucial for students to manage time effectively").  


#### **4. Present Participle Phrase as Result: "ensures a balanced approach..."**  
- **Structure**: *Main clause + present participle phrase* (no comma if the participle modifies the preceding noun; with a comma if it shows result).  
- **Function**: Expresses a consequence or result of the main action.  
- **Example in the Article**:  
  *"Allocating specific time slots for different activities ensures a balanced approach to work and leisure."* (Here, "ensures" is the main verb, and the phrase explains the outcome of "allocating time slots.")  
- **Extended Example**: "She practiced daily, improving her language skills rapidly." (present participle "improving" shows the result of "practiced daily")  


These structures are foundational for IELTS/TOEFL Writing (e.g., Task 2 essays) and Speaking (e.g., Part 3 discussions), as they demonstrate grammatical complexity and precision—key criteria for high band scores.
