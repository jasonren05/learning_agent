### 3. Key Grammatical Structure Analysis (重点语法结构分析)  

#### 1. "Both...and..." for Coordination (并列结构 "both...and...")  
- **Original Sentence**: *"Effective time management is crucial for success in both academic and professional settings."*  
- **Structure**: "both A and B" connects two parallel noun phrases ("academic settings" and "professional settings") to emphasize that the scope of "success" includes two domains.  
- **Function**: Widens the context of the statement, showing that time management is relevant across multiple areas (not just one).  
- **Usage Tip**: Use "both...and..." to highlight inclusivity; ensure A and B are grammatically parallel (e.g., both nouns, both adjectives, or both clauses).  


#### 2. "By + Gerund Phrase" as a Manner Adverbial (方式状语 "By + 动名词短语")  
- **Original Sentence**: *"By prioritizing tasks and setting clear goals, individuals can enhance productivity and reduce stress."*  
- **Structure**: "By + gerund phrase" ("prioritizing tasks and setting clear goals") functions as an adverbial phrase, explaining *how* individuals achieve the result ("enhance productivity and reduce stress").  
- **Key Detail**: The gerund phrase contains parallel gerunds ("prioritizing... and setting..."), maintaining balance in the sentence.  
- **Usage Tip**: This structure is common in academic/professional writing to explain methods or strategies (e.g., "By analyzing data and conducting surveys, researchers identified trends").  


#### 3. Non-Restrictive Relative Clause with "which" (非限制性定语从句 "which")  
- **Original Sentence**: *"Moreover, it fosters discipline and self-control, which are essential for achieving long-term objectives."*  
- **Structure**: "which" introduces a non-restrictive relative clause that adds extra information about "discipline and self-control" (not defining them, but explaining their importance).  
- **Punctuation Note**: Non-restrictive clauses are set off by commas, as they are not critical to the sentence’s core meaning.  
- **Usage Tip**: Use "which" (not "that") for non-restrictive clauses to elaborate on a noun/phrase, making writing more descriptive (e.g., "She practices daily, which has improved her skills significantly").  


#### 4. "Not just...; it is..." for Emphasis (强调结构 "not just...; it is...")  
- **Original Sentence**: *"In a world where distractions are abundant, mastering time management is not just beneficial; it is imperative..."*  
- **Structure**: This structure contrasts two adjectives ("beneficial" and "imperative") to escalate the importance of the statement—moving from "helpful" to "absolutely necessary."  
- **Function**: Creates rhetorical emphasis, strengthening the argument by showing that time management is more than just useful; it is critical.  
- **Usage Tip**: Use this pattern to highlight a stronger, more urgent claim (e.g., "Learning a language is not just a hobby; it is a tool for global communication").
