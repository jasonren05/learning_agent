### 3. 重点语法结构分析 (Key Grammatical Structure Analysis)

1.  **"By + Gerund (-ing form)" Adverbial Phrase (方式状语从句):**
    *   **Example in text:** "By prioritizing tasks and setting clear goals, individuals can enhance productivity and reduce stress."
    *   **Analysis:** The phrase "By prioritizing tasks and setting clear goals" functions as an adverbial phrase indicating **method or means**. It explains *how* individuals can "enhance productivity and reduce stress."
    *   **Structure:** "By" + [gerund phrase] + [main clause].
    *   **Usage:** This structure is very common in academic and professional writing to explain the method, means, or process by which an action is achieved or a result is obtained. It adds formality and conciseness.

2.  **"Which" Relative Clause (Non-restrictive/Non-defining Clause) (非限制性定语从句):**
    *   **Example in text:** "Moreover, it fosters discipline and self-control, which are essential for achieving long-term objectives."
    *   **Analysis:** The clause "which are essential for achieving long-term objectives" is a non-restrictive relative clause. It provides **additional, non-essential information** about the nouns "discipline and self-control." It is set off by commas.
    *   **Structure:** [Main clause] + ", which" + [additional information about the antecedent].
    *   **Usage:** This structure is used to give extra information that is not crucial to identifying the noun it modifies but adds further explanation or clarification. The pronoun "which" refers back to the entire noun phrase "discipline and self-control."

3.  **"Not just...; it is imperative..." Correlative Conjunction/Emphatic Structure (强调结构):**
    *   **Example in text:** "mastering time management is not just beneficial; it is imperative for maintaining a competitive edge and leading a fulfilling life."
    *   **Analysis:** This structure uses "not just" (meaning "not only") to introduce a lesser degree or aspect, and then contrasts it with "it is imperative" to emphasize a far greater degree of importance or necessity. The semicolon (;) connects the two independent clauses to show their close relationship and the contrast.
    *   **Structure:** [Subject] + [verb] + not just + [adjective/noun]; it is + [stronger adjective/noun] + [for ...].
    *   **Usage:** This is a powerful rhetorical device to emphasize the significance of something by first acknowledging a lesser truth and then asserting a more profound or urgent one. "Imperative" (meaning absolutely necessary) is a very strong word choice here.
